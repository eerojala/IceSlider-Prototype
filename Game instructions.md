# Basic game instructions

The goal of the game is to reach the exit alive. Clicking anywhere on the screen will make the player character move towards the clicking point. Touching the lava, patrolling enemies and 
cannonball explosions will cause the player character to die and restart from the beginning of the level. If the player character enters an ice tile while moving towards the clicking 
point, the player character will keep sliding towards the direction of the original clicking point until they reach a ground tile or collide with an object that results in death. You 
may exit the game any time by pressing the ESC key.

# Specific level instructions

## Level 1

You must collect two keys which will allow you to open the two gates blocking your path to the goal. You may NOT steer the player character while on ice. Entering the goal will advance 
you to the 2nd level.

## Level 2

At the beginning of the level there are boots which will allow the player character to steer theirselves while on ice. These are an absolute necessity to navigate the curvy, icy path to
the level goal. As this is the final level, reaching the goal will automatically close the game.
